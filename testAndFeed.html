                    <p>I just want to tell you how absolutely amazing my dock is. People have been coming by in kayaks and boats to look at it and comment how great it looks. I had a family party and everyone thought it was an incredible dock. Thank you so much!"</p>

                    <p style="width: 47.5%; float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 20px; text-align: justify">I want to give a big Thank You to E-Z- Docking Solutions. You really came through. We have been trying for so long to get someone to help with our problem with that stone hill to my daughters house. My arthritis in my feet has proven to be so bad that I cannot make the climb. Having no results with contractors calling back or following up I decided to try a docking ramp. (Being from the seaside in Maine)  Looked you folks up and being in Nottingham it seemed like a perfect fix. You were just that.</p>
                    <p style="width: 47.5%; float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: justify">I really felt sorry for Adam and Chris on that hot day but they did a wonderful job and it was not easy. They worked hard and moved many rocks to leave a perfect job. They were great. I was so happy and tried it out immediately. My daughter will be planting shrubs on the side with the railing and we will send you pictures.</p>
                    <p>You have five stars and more with us. Thank you Again!</p>
                    <br>
